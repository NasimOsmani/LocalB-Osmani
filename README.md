# LocalBite — Share Homemade Meals with Your Community

LocalBite is an ongoing group project for our **CSE470: Software Engineering** course.
It is a community-focused web application that helps students and local residents share homemade meals, reduce food waste, and connect with nearby home cooks.

This project is being developed using the MERN stack and follows the MVC architecture.
We are currently working on the core features, UI design, and backend structure.

The platform focuses on:

- Encouraging community bonding
